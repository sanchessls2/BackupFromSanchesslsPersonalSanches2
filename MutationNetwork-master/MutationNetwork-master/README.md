# C# neural network

Neural network capable of forward passing and mutation driven learning

##  Dependiencies

* Unity

[Install unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). 

## Usage

The files will appear you your assets

With unity installed you can go to assets/scene/environment.unity and open it

If you dont want to wait for the model to train. you can load the pretrained model txt files from with in manager InitNetworks function

## Process of creation and explanation of neural networks

I wrote a medium article explaining in simple terms how neural networks work, this can be found at: https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-neural-network-framework-in-c-16ef56ce1fef
